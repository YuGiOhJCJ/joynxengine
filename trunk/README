 JoyNXEngine [1] is a clone of the Cave Story video game with a joystick feature.
 It exists a video game called Cave Story (also known as Doukutsu Monogatar) [2].
 An open source clone called NXEngine [3] has been written.
 Unfortunately, this clone does not support the joystick whereas this game is suited to be played with a joystick.
 So, JoyNXEngine has been written to resolve this problem.
